# Responsive-Portfolio

This project is to help hone our abilities with properly using and formatting code alongside the bootstrap template. 
Through the use of bootstrap's grid system, we're able to create more fluid web designs for portfolios and allow for a responsive design with easy navigation. 

The portfolio is seperated into 3 seperate sections. The About Me, the Portfolio and Contact Information. The links had been set up in the navigation bar to help navigate the area based on the respective sections described in the bar. 

The contact information section has all the necessary links to social media, email and phone lists.
